If you want, join us to have a little fun participating in short contests or enjoy supporting your fellow AFOLs!

**No registration needed**, just show up at the stage in the venue and let the organizers know that you're willing to have fun!

These activities will run through the entire afternoon on Saturday and Sunday.

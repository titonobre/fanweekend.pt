Hello {{NAME}}!

**WELCOME TO THE PAREDES DE COURA FAN WEEKEND!**

Thank you for signing up for this amazing event! We have received your registration and will get back to you soon with the payment details.

Here are some notes regarding your registration to the event.

This registration is mandatory for all participants, even if you won't display any models.

Due to the availability of the boarding houses the registration slots are limited. We'll try our best to accommodate everyone who signs up but, if the demand is too high, we might have to put you on a waiting list.

There is a registration fee of €150 (EURO) per person. Included with the fee is the following:

- Accommodation in boarding houses (B&B's) for three (3) nights.
- Meals: Breakfast, lunch, afternoon snacks, and dinner.
- Access to the AFOL lounge with a wide variety of drinks and snacks.
- Goodie bag and a participant wristband that gives you access to activities, workshops, presentations, and special offers.

There will be a special AFOLs dinner on Saturday. It has an extra cost of €30 (EURO) per person.

Unfortunately, the canteen will not be able to serve dinner to the participants that night. We'll be sorry not to see you at the AFOLs dinner, but in case you don't want to attend, several restaurants in the town can provide meals. Be sure to check them out in due time and perhaps make a dinner reservation in advance.

There are no shuttles or transport provided by the organization! You'll have to get to Paredes de Coura on your own. There are some budget car rentals online with very cheap rates that will allow you to rent a car at the many airports nearby. If you need any assistance to do this, just let us know. We will provide a free car park for the participants in one of the underground parking lots near the Exhibition Hall.

Registration will be divided into three phases:

1. Sign-up form submission.
2. Email confirmation with Payment details.
3. Validation of Registration.

Only once your payment has been confirmed will your registration be accepted as valid. After payment and validation, no refunds can be issued.

Please note that the main form of communication between the organization and the participants will be the Fan Weekend website at https://www.fanweekend.pt/.

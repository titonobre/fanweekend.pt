## Notes

Due to the availability of the boarding houses the registration slots are limited. We'll try our best to accommodate everyone who signs up but, if the demand is too high, we might have to put you on a waiting list.

There are no shuttles or transport provided by the organization! You'll have to get to Paredes de Coura on your own. There are some budget car rentals online with very cheap rates that will allow you to rent a car at the many airports nearby. If you need any assistance to do this, just let us know. We will provide a free car park for the participants in one of the underground parking lots near the Exhibition Hall.

Remember to bring your bikinis, bathing suits or shorts! Hats and sunblock as well.

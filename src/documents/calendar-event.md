The Paredes de Coura Fan Weekend is back in 2026!

We will once again turn the cosy little village of Paredes de Coura into the centre stage of the AFOL community. Hosted by the Comunidade 0937 we hope to gather LEGO® fans from all around the world and make this an unforgettable experience with passionate AFOLs, fantastic models and creations and insightful workshops!

The event takes place from 12 to 14 of June, 2026. Setup will be on 12 of June.

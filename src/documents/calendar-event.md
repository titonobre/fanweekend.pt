The Paredes de Coura Fan Weekend is back!

We will once again turn the cosy little village of Paredes de Coura into the centre stage of the AFOL community. Hosted by the Comunidade 0937 we hope to gather LEGOÂ® fans from all around the world and make this an unforgettable experience with passionate AFOLs, fantastic models and creations and insightful workshops!

The event takes place from 6 to 8 of June, 2025. Setup will be on 6 of June.

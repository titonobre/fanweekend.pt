      <p>The Paredes de Coura Fan Weekend is back!</p>
      <p>
        We will once again turn the cosy little village of Paredes de Coura into the centre stage of the AFOL community. Hosted by the
        Comunidade 0937 we hope to gather LEGOÂ® fans from all around the world and make this an unforgettable experience with passionate
        AFOLs, fantastic models and creations and insightful workshops!
